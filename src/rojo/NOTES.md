## OS Support

This Feature should work on recent versions of Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions with the `apt` package manager installed.

`bash` is required to execute the `install.sh` script.

`GLIBC_2.33`, `GLIBC_2.32`, or `GLIBC_2.34` are required to install [Aftman](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/aftman).
