## OS Support

This Feature should work on recent versions of Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions with the `apt` package manager installed. Debian `trixie` (or `debian-13`) or later is required because of the `GLIBC_2.39` requirement for Rojo.

`bash` is required to execute the `install.sh` script.

`GLIBC_2.33`, `GLIBC_2.32`, or `GLIBC_2.34` are required to install [Aftman](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/aftman) and [Rokit](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rokit). `GLIBC_2.39` is required to install [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo).
